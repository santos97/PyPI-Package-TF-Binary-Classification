Description: #TensorFLow-Binary-Image-Classifier
        
        A Python package to get train and test a model for binary classification.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Following query on terminal will allow you to TRAIN the data.
        Here c1 and c2 are two categories and has SAME folder name of the data.
        p is path of folder containing train data image folders.
        e is number of epoches
        EX:
        ```
        [Train_data] / 
                [not_human] , [human]
        
        train -c1 not_human -c2 human -p c:/downloads/train_data/ -e 3
        
        ```
        Following query on terminal will allow you to TEST the data.
        Here c1 and c2 are two categories and has SAME folder name of the data.
        p is path of folder containing test data image folder.
        EX:
        ```
        [Test_data] / 
                [folder]
        
        test -c1 not_human -c2 human -p c:/downloads/test_data/ 
        
        ```
